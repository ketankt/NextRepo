Analysis for N Queen Problem
Space complexity

For this algorithm it is O(N). The algorithm uses an auxiliary array of length N to store just N positions.

Time complexity

The isSafe method takes O(N) time as it iterates through our array every time.
For each invocation of the placeQueen method, there is a loop which runs for O(N) time.
In each iteration of this loop, there is isSafe invocation which is O(N) and a recursive call with a smaller argument.
If we add all this up and define the run time as T(N). Then T(N) = O(N2) + N*T(N-1).
If you draw a recursion tree using this recurrence, the final term will be something like n3+ n!O(1).
By the definition of Big O, this can be reduced to O(n!) running time.


Summary
Generally problems of backtracking can be easily identified by the following features:
Understand it will have a lot of solutions
Decide that not all solutions will solve the problem and you might have to go back and change something

First at each step, you have to verify the integrity of the solution. Like if it is safe to move etc
Recursive approach is used to take a step and simplify the problem
Every future step is used to check if the present choice is considered a valid choice or not.
No need to worry about the backtracking part, the recursion stack takes care of it.

Distribution of solution can be formed by a recursion tree
Under each parent node the child nodes are possible solution from parent arrangement
Game ends when you find out the message.
